setup for our project
Must have Windows** and an NvIDIA GPU*

(when asked for nvidia specifics look at the other pin if you have version < 1.5)
And the setup for the general rocket league bot is on the general discord

*Note: if you only want to collect data or run the bot you can run it on CPU version instead.

After installing tensorflow (which we recommend via pip3)
You most install a library called requests

pip3 install requests


If you only want to help train and can not generate data you must have an Nvidia GPU and Ubuntu/linux

To upload data to our server you must grab a config file from the discord
